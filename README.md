  # ðŸ§¼ Watermark Removal Using U-Net (PyTorch)

  This project leverages a deep learning model based on the **U-Net architecture** (implemented in PyTorch) to automatically detect and remove watermarks from images.

  It is designed for accessibilityâ€”even users with minimal machine learning background can set it up and use it effectively.

  ## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure (D: Drive)

  The project is organized into two main folders placed directly in the **D:** drive:

  ### D:/Watermark Removal

      D:/Watermark Removal/
      â”œâ”€â”€ unet_model.py               # Defines the U-Net architecture used for image translation
      â”œâ”€â”€ test_model.py               # Trains and runs the watermark removal process
      â”œâ”€â”€ generate_watermark_images.py# Adds synthetic watermarks to clean images (useful for data generation)
      â”œâ”€â”€ README.md                   # Project documentation
      â””â”€â”€ References.docx             # Research references and contributions

  ### D:/Watermark Images

      D:/Watermark Images/
      â”œâ”€â”€ Clean/                      # Folder with clean images (no watermark)
      â”œâ”€â”€ Watermarked/                # Folder with watermarked images (used as input)
      â””â”€â”€ Predicted/                     # Folder for saving output images with watermark removed

  ## ðŸ“„ Explanation of Key Scripts

  ### ðŸ”¹ `unet_model.py`

  This file defines the **U-Net architecture**, which is crucial to the success of the project. U-Net is a convolutional neural network designed for precise pixel-level tasks like segmentation and restoration.  
  In our case, it's used to learn how to reconstruct clean images from their watermarked counterparts.

  ### ðŸ”¹ `test_model.py`

  This script handles both **training** the model and **inference**. When run, it:
  - Loads the image pairs (watermarked and clean)
  - Trains the U-Net model using MSE loss
  - Applies the trained model to all images in the `Watermarked/` folder
  - Saves the clean output in the `Predicted/` directory

  ### ðŸ”¹ `generate_watermark_images.py`

  This is a utility script that helps **create synthetic datasets**. If you donâ€™t have access to a large dataset of watermarked images, you can:
  - Download clean images from the internet
  - Place them inside the `Clean/` folder
  - Run this script to automatically apply random watermarks to each image, saving them in the `Watermarked/` folder

      python generate_watermark_images.py

  This step helps simulate real-world scenarios and is ideal for training your model when data is limited.

  ## ðŸ”§ Requirements

  Make sure you have **Python 3.10 or higher** installed.

  Install dependencies:

      pip install torch torchvision opencv-python numpy

  ---

  ## ðŸš€ How to Run

  1. Place your **clean images** in `D:/Watermark Images/Clean/`
  2. If needed, use the watermark generator script:

      python generate_watermark_images.py

  3. Run the training and inference process:

      python test_model.py

  4. Processed (cleaned) images will be saved to `D:/Watermark Images/Predicted/`

  ## ðŸ§  Training Details

  - The U-Net model is trained using **pixel-wise MSE loss**
  - Input: Watermarked image
  - Target: Corresponding clean image
  - Output: Reconstructed watermark-free image

  The model learns to minimize the difference between the predicted image and the actual clean image during training.
