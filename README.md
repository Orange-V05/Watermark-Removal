  # ðŸ§¼ Watermark Removal Using U-Net (PyTorch)

  This project leverages a deep learning model based on the **U-Net architecture** (implemented in PyTorch) to automatically detect and remove watermarks from images.

  It is designed for easy useâ€”even by users with minimal machine learning experience.

  ## ðŸ”§ Requirements

  Make sure you have **Python 3.10 or higher** installed.

  Install the required Python packages:

      pip install torch torchvision opencv-python numpy

  ## ðŸš€ How to Use

  Follow these steps to run the watermark removal project:

  ### 1. Prepare the Image Dataset

  - Save your **watermarked images** in the `Watermarked/` folder.  
    Supported formats: `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`

  - Save the **clean versions** of the same images (without watermark) in the `Clean/` folder.  
    Filenames must match the watermarked ones exactly.

  ### 2. Run the Script

      python test_model.py

  - The script will train the model on the dataset provided.
  - After training, it will process **all** watermarked images and save the watermark-free versions in the `output/` folder.

  ## ðŸ§  Model Architecture

  - The model uses the **U-Net architecture**, effective for image-to-image tasks like segmentation and restoration.
  - The model is trained using **Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss** to learn pixel-wise transformations between watermarked and clean images.
